1. 3

2. 150

3. 150

4. [ 50, 100, 150 ] because discounted is an array and keeps getting the final price pushed all three times therefore it will get 50, 100, and 150 since it goes through the for loop.

5. line 13 gives an error because "let" only allowd i to be in the for loop block, meaning when line 13 tries to print i, there is no reference to it causing an error.

6. line 13 causes an error because the "let" variable makes "discountedPrice" only exist in the for loop so it doesn't exist when it is called in the console log

7. 150

8. [ 50, 100, 150] because the discounted is defined within the function meaning that it will exist and it will be returned.

9. This will give an error, i is defined with let meaning it only exists in the for loop, meaning this doesnt exist for the console log

10. 3, because the array input to discountPrices length is 3, meaning that when length is defined with prices.length, it is set to 3 and console log will print that value of 3.

11. The function returns the discounted array of [ 50, 100, 150 ] because even though discounted is a const, it is an array, which means values can still be inserted into the array giving it the same value as if it was a regular var.
